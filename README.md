Computer Vision: Image Enhancement
==============================
## Computer Vision Topics: Image Histogram Operations, Edge Detection Kernels 

This repository contains material exploring the following topics:
* histogram operations (contrast enhancement, thresholding, equalization)
* edge detection kernels (1x2 operator and Sobel operator)
* exploration of the effect of automatically finding thresholds for operations, changing the size of kernels, and edge detection on grayscale and colored images
